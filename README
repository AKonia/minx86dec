Minimalist 80x86 decompiler library.
Use for any program or tool you write to decompile opcodes.
Written in plain C for speed and lightness.

core8086.c             8086/8088 decoding engine
corenecv20.c           80186 NEC V20/V30 decoding engine
core286.c              286 decoding engine
core386.c              386 decoding engine
core486.c              486 decoding engine
core586.c              Pentium decoding engine
core586pro.c           Pentium Pro decoding engine
core686.c              686 or higher-level (Pentium II or higher) decoding engine
core6x86_cyrix.c       Cyrix decoding engine (including Cyrix MMX)
coreall.c              General-purpose x86 decoding engine (all instructions, except those replaced by newer instructions)
coreall_x64.c          General-purpose x86-64 decoding engine (for decoding instructions in 64-bit long mode)

And using the same library, you can also ENCODE opcodes, using the decompiled instruction struct.
This makes it easy to implement assemblers, dynamic recompilers and JIT engines.

encoreall.c            General-purpose x86 encoding engine (all instructions, including those that overlap)
