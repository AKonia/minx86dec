An alternative implementation, based on a master list of instruction forms
that is "compiled" into the core instruction decoder. This makes it a LOT
easier to add new instructions as they come along.

But currently this is very experimental and may be broken for a long time.

The list is designed to be run through the C preprocessor to allow #includes,
#defines, #ifdef, etc. Hopefully what I'm doing is less sinful than what
X-Windows used to do :)
