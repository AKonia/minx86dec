TODO:
   What else does the Cyrix MII bring to the opcode table?
   The Cyrix 6x86?
   The Cyrix III?
   Do we need a Cyrix 5x86 decoder?
TODO:
   Core and decoder that supports Intel AVX prefixes (which re-use illegal
   forms of LDS/LES opcodes to represent two or three byte shorthand
   prefixes). BTW Does NASM support these?
TODO:
   Finish adding the rest of the MMX/SSE instructions and you'll be done!
   Check latest Intel docs and AMD docs for any new instructions that might
   have been added.
TODO:
   There's a lot of redundant code in the X86 core, specifically related to
   register assignment and such. Can you reduce that down to macros to provide
   more concise readable code that's less redundant?
